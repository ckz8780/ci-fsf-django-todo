# Welcome!

This is a quick demo repo for demonstrating various parts of Django. It's part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module for CodeInstitute.

There is a live version at https://ci-fsf-django-todo.herokuapp.com (Note that this is a free dyno and may go to sleep! Be patient on initial load.)

**IMPORTANT**: The link above is actually attached to the [extended version of this project](https://github.com/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-testing) - code in this repo may differ from the code running at that link! If you want to see the code running at the link, go to the other repo!
